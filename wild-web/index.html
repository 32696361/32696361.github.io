It is 99,99% that a passport reader device has already scanned your passport, most probably at an airport. These scanners are used for enhancing security at border control, law enforcement and other governmental applications. Read below to get familiar with the passport reading technology. A passport scanner is actually a camera â€“ a purpose-built imaging device that takes photos of the presented identity documents. The difference between a regular camera and a passport scanner is the following: a passport scanner uses special illuminations when capturing the document; in addition to visible white, it includes infrared and ultraviolet light sources as well. The images taken under these illuminations are used as inputs for specific image processing tasks: mainly for data reading and document verification.

During the passport reading process, the OCR software analyze the scanned images. First, it identifies the document type, then digitalizes the characters. It results in segmented personal and document data, such as name, date of birth, nationality, document number, expiry data and more. All these data are gathered within 1-2 seconds only.

Passport verification<br>

The images, scanned under various illuminations go through a deep software analysis to find discrepancies compared to reference images of genuine identity documents. Also, these systems are capable of cross-checking visual and digital data, for example comparing the printed photo and the digital photo that is stored in the RFID chip.

                    Genetic testing
                </div>

                    Once a person decides to proceed with genetic testing, a health care provider can arrange testing. Genetic testing is often done as part of a genetic consultation.
<br><br>
Genetic tests are performed on a sample of blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a procedure called a buccal smear uses a small brush or cotton swab to collect a sample of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorder. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person's doctor or genetic counselor, or directly to the patient if requested.
<br><br>
Newborn screening tests are done on a small blood sample, which is taken by pricking the baby's heel. Unlike other types of genetic testing, a parent will usually only receive the result if it is positive. If the test result is positive, additional testing is needed to determine whether the baby has a genetic disorder.
<br><br>
Before a person has a genetic test, it is important to understand the testing procedure, the benefits and limitations of the test, and the possible consequences of the test results. The process of educating a person about the test and obtaining permission is called informed consent.

Individuals interested in direct-to-consumer genetic testing do not need to go through a health care provider to obtain a test, but they can get it directly from the testing company. After undergoing direct-to-consumer genetic testing, people who test positive for a condition or are found to be at higher risk of developing a disorder are encouraged to follow-up with a genetic counselor or other health care provider.
